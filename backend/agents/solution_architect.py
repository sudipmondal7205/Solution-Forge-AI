            Design the system architecture considering the MVP scope,
            expected traffic, timeline, and cloud preferences.

            You must define:

            1. Architecture style
            2. Major system components
            3. Component connections
            4. Database design
            5. Cache strategy
            6. Data flow
            7. Security approach
            8. Scalability approach
            9. MVP architecture
            10. Future evolution
            11. Architecture rationale
            12. Architecture risks

            - Respect the business requirements.
            - Prioritize MVP-first architecture.
            - Do not introduce unnecessary complexity.
            - Consider scalability and maintainability.
            - Consider security requirements.
            - Respect the user's constraints and preferences.
            - Do not make technology choices that belong to the
            Technology Advisor.
            - Every connection source and target must refer to an
            existing component id.
            - Return ONLY valid JSON matching EXACTLY the expected schema.
