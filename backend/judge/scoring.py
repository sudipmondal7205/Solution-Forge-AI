"""Deterministic scoring.

The LLM scores individual criteria and supplies evidence. This module — not
the model — computes the weighted total, applies hard-constraint penalties and
assigns the quality band. That keeps the headline number reproducible and
auditable: the same criterion scores always yield the same result.

Formula
-------
    weighted_score(c) = criterion_score(c) * weight(c) / 100
    raw_weighted_total = sum(weighted_score(c) for c in criteria)
    constraint_penalty = min(MAX_TOTAL_PENALTY,
                             sum(penalty[severity] for each FAILED check))
    overall_score = clamp(raw_weighted_total - constraint_penalty, 0, 100)

WARN checks carry half the penalty of a FAIL at the same severity; PASS checks
carry none.
